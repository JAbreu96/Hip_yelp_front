##  **[Travlr](https://travlr-group.netlify.app/)**

This is site for people who want to explore local foods and drinks. Users can click on individual tabs of food and drink to explore what they like to checkout. Then users can click on map to see all the locations in one click. 

## Why?

This page was inspired by popular search sites such as yelp, foursquare, ect. This particular application employs the use of a tag system and user created data to display trending food and drink places in the New York Area.

## Add 
The add page allows a user to submit a new place to the database. When an address is inputted into the form, it is first sent to a geocoding api that will return the longitude and latitude of the place. This info, as well as the address, and the selected tags are submitted to the database.
